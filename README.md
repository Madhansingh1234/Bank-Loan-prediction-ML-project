🏦 Bank Loan Approval Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution that predicts whether a bank should approve a loan based on customer details. It is designed using Python and common ML libraries and is ideal for beginners interested in classification problems and data science.
📌 Overview

Banks receive many loan applications, and it's important to automate the approval process for faster and more accurate decisions. This project helps predict loan approvals using past application data and machine learning algorithms.
